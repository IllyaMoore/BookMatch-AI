# Books Photo Recommender

**Books Photo Recommender** is a dynamic project capable of adapting its logic based on user input.  
The system can use images (such as book covers) or text titles to perform various tasks:

- **Book recommendations** based on style, mood, or genre.  
- **Book summarization** from a photo or contextual hints.  
- **Finding similar works** by theme, tone, or visual aesthetics.  

Its architecture allows flexible behavior â€” the model can act as a **creative generator**, a **literary style analyst**, or a **recommendation system**, depending on the prompt.  
This makes the project a versatile tool for exploring the connection between **text, imagery, and narrative**.
